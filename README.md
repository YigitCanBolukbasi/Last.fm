##  What was done

Requested and returned data are kept in cache with React Query.Thus, performance is ensured by not pulling data repeatedly.
The data coming later is distributed to the components with the help of functions.
dark mode works synchronously in the whole structure thanks to context.
In addition, hooks and tests are used.
